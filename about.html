                <p>Hey! I am an adolescent interested in programming. I started programming at a young age, when I was 6 years old. Back then, I was introduced to very basic HTML code, and Scratch. I got hooked on Scratch for 6 whole years, and I made a number of projects which I shared to the community.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="col-sm-8">
                <p>I left Scratch on February 2019. Since then, I have been focusing on real programming (and my schoolwork). During spring 2019, I learnt C++ and started to do game development with Unity. I also expanded my knowledge on Python and JavaScript largely, by making loads of little projects using them.</p>

                <p>During the summer of 2019, I started playing around with a Raspberry Pi my father bought, and learned the basics of Linux. I used it to create the (still not complete) back-end API for a new, larger, and more ambitious project I have in mind, Padscape. It is an online code editor with support for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it will feature users, pads, and many more in the future.</p>

                <p>Apart from coding, I have loads of other hobbies. I love athletics, swimming, and martial arts, and I play basketball and table tennis regularly. I enjoy solving any kind of puzzles and brain teasers. I spend a lot of my time cubing, or solving math equations, and pondering stuff about science. I won't have much time to do that anymore though, as I recently started attending junior high school and we have a lot of schoolwork...</p>
