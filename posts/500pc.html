        <h2 class="text-center">The Best $500 Gaming PC</h2>
        <br><br>
        <div class="container">
            <p>Building a PC by yourself for the first time is not a very easy task, especially when your budget is tight. That's the reason why I have created this guide on making the best cheap PC possible. If you want to play AAA titles in medium settings on 75+ FPS, or if you have relatively modest needs, this build is for you!</p>
            <br>
            <p class="slideanim">You may think that to be able to have a good gaming experience, you need to have a more expensive PC. If so, you will be surprised at what a $500 budget can get you. However, it is quite hard to choose quality parts in a 500$ budget. Many compromises had to be made: In order to fit a dedicated GPU, I had to buy a cheap case and a power supply of 450 watts. These will suit you for a while, but if you plan to upgrade your build, you might need a bit more power. In addition, at this price point, you have to stick with the stock coolers. In our build, the Wraith Spire cooler included in our CPU is actually pretty capable, and can handle a mild overclock. If you add less temperature-efficient parts (like an i9 9900K), you would have to buy a better cooler.</p>
            <p class="slideanim">The case is not something really fancy - it has just one fan and no cool RGB lighting. Despite that, it offers very good airflow for its price and is manifactured by a reliable brand. I have put a lot of emphasis on our SSD; this build rocks 500GB of fast NVMe storage! The dual-channel RAM is quite good, running at a 3200MHz frequency.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="slideanim">From a performance standpoint, this build has the capability to play Fortnite at medium settings at 1080p/75+ FPS. The 12-thread CPU is perfect for multitasking and is a great choice for developers and graphics designers. Note that <b>this PC has not been tested in real life</b> and the FPS is just an estimation. But enough talking; let's see the build itself!</p>

            <h2 class="text-center">Rig Details</h2>
            <p>You might be wondering why I chose these specific parts instaed of others. Starting from the CPU, the Ryzen 5 1600 AF may seem like a two-generation-old processor. But, in reality, it uses the 12nm process seen in Zen+ CPUs. This processor performs just as well as the Ryzen 5 2600 for 50$ less! It is a killer deal!</p>
            <p>The GPU serves up excellent performance in 1080p and its competitive pricing makes it the best budget graphics card. It is faster than the GTX 1650 and is not far behind the GTX 1060.</p>
            <p>The motherboard has three PCIe slots, four SATA 3 conectors, large VRM heatsinks and two M.2 slots! It enables you to achieve 4.2 GHz CPU overclock at 1.425V! That is quite something for a product that is available for less than 80$!</p>
            <p>The RAM costs less than 70$ but still operates at a 3200MHz frequency. 16GB is perfect for gaming and people with more modest needs might never use them all. And it also looks awesome!</p>
            <p>The NVMe comes from a reliable brand and its quality is not to be questioned. We are living at an age in which solid-state drives have never been cheaper before. This allows people to use SSDs in budget PCs! If you were to say that 10 years ago, nobody would believe you...</p>
            <p>Despite being only 450W, this power supply offers great efficiency and a rifle-bearing fan. Apart from that, it has a five-year warranty (but you won't need it).</p>
            <p>The construction and style of the case I chose are pretty good, especially given that the Q300L can be found for under 50$. It even has radiator support, so you <i>could</i> install a 240mm liquid cooler.</p>
